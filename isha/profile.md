Academically I was never atopper by i was a multidirectional learning enthusiast . I was in sports like football ,shotput, discuss , etc. which gave me a sense of working in and with the team and one of the great life lessons ,‚Äùto never quit‚Äù. Had 9+ capacity in sem 1. With sports I have some roots in art like I have learnt harmonium for few years and had learned Bharatnatyam for 5 years. Since a kid I was keen on learning new stuff not because im some kind of a genius, nah I was just a kid who liked to try out everything in life  so that I don‚Äôt have any regrets . Also I used to do poetry and had a Instagram blog writing channel. Fun fact currently my insta is hacked so couldn‚Äôt be able to mention my main acc. but will mention my blog acc.
